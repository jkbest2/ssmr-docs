## Why write a new model?

- BTSPAS is great, but has some weaknesses
- Other models focus on estimating pHOS and other metrics that are not at play here
- Other models focus on a single species in a single year
  
::: {.notes}
- BTSPAS and others require choosing a temporal stratification
- BTSPAS written in JAGS; Stan is better
- Requires downscaling covariates
- Difficult to account for missing trapping days
- Use hierarchical models to share information among species and/or years
:::

## Why now?

![](figs/cow-map.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- Three listed species: LCR Chinook, LCR Steelhead, LCR/SW Coho
- Tacoma Power is required to transport 95% of juveniles downstream
- Over the past two decades of their license, they've never succeeded
- Have used dodgy methods for estimating collection efficiency
  
- FERC license requires 95% Fish Passage Survival, defined as proportion of fish that arrive at Lake Scanewa and are released alive below Mayfield Dam
- FPS is defined as the proportion of juveniles that enter Lake Scanewa who are released alive from the Acclimation ponds downstream of Mayfield Dam
:::

## Where are we?

![](figs/scan-map.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- Cowlitz Falls Dam formed Lake Scanewa at the confluence of the Cowlitz and Cispus Rivers
- We know how many fish are released alive, so we need to estimate the number that enter the reservoir
- We have the number of unmarked fish collected each day, so we need

- A large portion of this is Fish Collection Efficiency, the proportion of available fish that are collected for dowstream transport.
- Mark recapture studies have been going on for a number of years (2013? 2016?)
- A subset of juveniles are marked when captured, then transported to Day Use Park and released
- Recaptures at the fish collector are then used to estimate Fish Collection Efficiency
- Roughly 3.3km or 2mi from Day Use Park to the Fish Collector
:::

## How can we model this process?

- Juveniles are captured at the collector
- Some are tagged and released upstream
- Tagged fish take some time to travel back to the collector
- There they are recaptured with some probability
- This probability is assumed the same as the unmarked fish

## What do we need to model?

1. Recapture delay/travel time
2. Probability of capture
3. Unmarked arrival rate
   
::: {.notes}
- The specification of each of these will affect the others
- Any of them could (in theory) include covariate effects
:::

## How long before a released fish is available for recapture?

- Not particularly well informed
- Difficult to identify vs. probability of capture
- Functional forms can use a CDF or PDF approach
- Different for each species
- Changes over the collection season
- May have different behaviors within releases (migrating vs. rearing)

::: {.notes}
- Identification difficulty means that it should be chosen somewhat conservatively, so that information can go to probability of capture
:::

## How long before a released fish is available for recapture?

CDF Approach

$$\alpha_t = \Phi(t, \boldsymbol{\theta}) - \Phi(t - 1, \boldsymbol{\theta})$$

## How long before a released fish is available for recapture?

CDF Approach

```{r}
#| dpi: 300
df <- tibble(
  x = seq(0, 35, 0.1),
  y = dexp(x, rate = 1 / 5),
  y1 = ifelse(ceiling(x) %% 2, y, NA),
  y2 = ifelse(ceiling(x) %% 2, NA, y)
) |>
  mutate(
    y1 = ifelse(!(x %% 1), y, y1),
    y2 = ifelse(!(x %% 1), y, y2)
  )

df2 <- tibble(
  x = 1:35,
  y = dexp(x, rate = 1 / 5),
  pr = pexp(x, rate = 1 / 5) - pexp(x - 1, rate = 1 / 5),
  prlab = scales::percent(pr, accuracy = 0.1)
)

ggplot(df, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = y1),
    fill = "gray80"
  ) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = y2),
    fill = "gray50"
  ) +
  geom_line(aes(y = y)) +
  geom_text(
    data = df2, aes(y = y, label = prlab),
    nudge_x = 0.1, nudge_y = 0.005

## How long before a released fish is available for recapture?

PDF Approach

$$\begin{aligned}
\alpha_t &= \frac{\exp \left\{\phi(t - 0.5, \boldsymbol{\theta}) + \epsilon_t\right\}}
{\sum_t \exp \left\{\phi(t - 0.5, \boldsymbol{\theta}) + \epsilon_t\right\}}\\
\epsilon_t &\sim \operatorname{MVN}(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}),
\end{aligned}$$

- Allows inclusion of random effects
- More general functional forms, including nonparametrics like splines
  
## Once available, how long does it remain available?

- Easy for in-river smolt traps like screw traps
- May be worth extending for dam-based fish collectors
  
$$\alpha_t = a_t +(1 - p_{t-1})(1 - \ell_{t-1})a_{t-1} + \cdots$$

- Difficult to include explicit $\ell$

::: {.notes}
- Multiple day availability may allow for incorporation of e.g. spill as increased loss in a given day. May also smooth out effects of travel time functional form?
:::

## What proportion of available fish will be captured?

$$\begin{aligned}
&\operatorname{logit^{-1}}(p_t) = \boldsymbol{X}\boldsymbol{\beta}\\
&\boldsymbol{Y} \sim \operatorname{multinomial}\left(N, \left(\alpha_{r+1} p_{r+1}, \ldots, \alpha_{r+T} p_{r+T}, 1 - \sum_{t = 1}^T \alpha_{r+t} p_{r+t}\right) \right)
\end{aligned}$$

- Nuisance parameters in some cases
- Important at Cowlitz, may inform operations
- Many potential covariates, can include a temporal smoother
- Include offset to account for days trap is closed
  
::: {.notes}
- Nature of the temporal smoother determined by prior placed on $\beta$
- Currently using `mgcv` smoothers, so many options
:::
  
## What proportion of available fish will be captured?

![](figs/full_est_prob_capture.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- This includes a yearly intercept and a temporal smooth to account for variation not due to temperature or discharge
:::

## How do covariates affect capture probability?

![](figs/full_temp_discharge_withobs.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- No releases were done early (low temperatures) or late season (high temperatures) so we don't have much information
- But still need to extrapolate to this area in order to infer the number of fish available during those days
:::

## How many unmarked fish are arriving each day?

- Assume arrivals are an inhomogeneous Poisson process
- Each fish is collected with the capture probability
- Includes temporal smoother
- Lower variability during off-peak migration
- Higher variability during peak migration
- Not capturing enough variability

::: {.notes}
- This implies arrivals are independent of each other
- Thinned Poisson is still Poisson
- Could consider Poisson multinomial trick
:::

## How many unmarked fish are arriving each day?

![](figs/full_run_est.png){fig-align="center"}

::: {.notes}
- This includes variation due to the Poisson process
- Some issues to address here with the observations being larger than expected in a few places
- Uses a lower-truncated Poisson to condition on number of observed fish
:::

## Questions

- Which of the three models should include covariate effects?
- Which covariates to include?
- Should I include nonlinear covariate effects? Interactions?
  
- Which travel time form should I use?

- How to account for extra variability in unmarked arrivals?
- How to choose priors?

- Which model misspecifications will be most important to check in a simulation study?

## Future work

- Extrapolate arrival rates to determine how many fish are missed in the off season
- Allow for batch marks
- Explore individual covariates
